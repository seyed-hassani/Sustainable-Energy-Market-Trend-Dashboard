# Sustainable Energy Market Trend Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project visualizes and analyzes renewable energy trends across Canadian provinces to support strategic planning and investment in the clean energy sector. It simulates how a company or policymaker might use data to inform expansion decisions and highlight growth areas in solar, wind, and hydro energy.
